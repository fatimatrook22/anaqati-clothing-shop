# About us
This system is an effort to reduce some common issues that arise during the business for this type of company. We are providing this software without warranty; use as desired, modify as necessary and don't forget to contribute to the project's improvement if you find any bugs. <br>
There is still much to be done, but with enough time, we think we can develop a standard piece of software for this kind of business. Although this piece of software is not even close to being competitive with those used in the industry, it offers a modest alternative for those who cannot afford the high costs of proprietary software. Enjoy.
