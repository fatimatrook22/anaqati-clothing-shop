## 📘 About Us

This system is an effort to reduce some common issues that arise during the business for this type of company. 
We are providing this software without warranty; use as desired, modify as necessary and don't forget to contribute 
to the project's improvement if you find any bugs.

There is still much to be done, but with enough time, we think we can develop a standard piece of software for 
this kind of business. Although this piece of software is not even close to being competitive with those used 
in the industry, it offers a modest alternative for those who cannot afford the high costs of proprietary software. 
Enjoy.
